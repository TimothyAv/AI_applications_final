# Object Detection for Surveillance and Security in Hospitals

## Overview

Image classification is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence (AI) in which pictures are classified into predetermined classes or labels. 
It is critical in a variety of real-world applications, including facial recognition and driverless cars, 
as well as medical imaging and content filtering on social media platforms. Many AI systems rely on the ability 
to effectively identify pictures to make educated judgments and respond intelligently to visual data.
